Integrating buses, planes and trains is a messy business. Every country seems to have their approach of managing and distributing data. That's why we've launched [Planar Network Feeds](/projects/feeds), a hub for public transit tooling and data sets.

[GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) is the standard used to drive the journey planner behind [traintickets.to](https://traintickets.to), as such we have lots of tooling to transform industry data sets to GTFS. We've made open and available for everyone. 

You'll find tools to convert CIF format (UK rail), TransXChange (UK bus) and SSIM (IATA flights) with more to follow soon.
