UK bus data is now available in GTFS format on the [Planar Network Feeds](/projects/feeds) website.
{: .article-headline}

The data is provided by [Traveline](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/0447f8d9-8f1b-4a68-bbc8-246981d02256/traveline-national-dataset) and published weekly.

Each region has it's own data set and the [transxchange2gtfs](https://github.com/planarnetwork/transxchange2gtfs) tool also generates a combined UK data set. You can read more about  the [transxchange to GTFS conversion](https://github.com/planarnetwork/transxchange2gtfs).

[Get it now](/projects/feeds).
